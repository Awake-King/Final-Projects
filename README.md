This is my final project for C++.

Some examples of my code are:
void enterSugar();
void calcHemo();
void calcSugar();
void reviewSugar();
void onlineInfo();
The coding for this program is based on keeping track of your blood sugars, getting averages,
checking your approximate hemoglobin A1C and and getting more information on diabetes type 1 and 2.

The motivation behind this project is that I am a diabetic and I wanted to come up with a way to keep
myself interested and wanting to keep better track and take better care of my illness.


You can get my code here: https://github.com/Awake-King/Final-Projects/blob/master/Finalish%20Project-1.cpp
All you need to do is go to the link and then download or copy the code.


When you run this program, it will give you a list of options of what it can do. Depending on the options that you choose
it will take and add your blood sugars to a list to keep track of them. It can calculate your hemoglobin A1C, give you the 
averages of all your blood sugars. Allow you to review your blood sugar and give online information that will further
your knowledge of your diabetes.
